# Basic
## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. 

While it's not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large lists, it's useful for educational purposes and for small lists where simplicity is more important than speed.

## Merge sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. 

Space Complexity: O(n)
Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)): It's the most efficient to sort multiple types of data.
