------------ ANALYSE TIME COMPLEXITY -----------

*** Task 0
    I retrieve data from list by a known index, so the time complexity is O(1).

*** Task 1
    There's a loop through N records of texts and calls.
    Inside the loop, I used the IN operator to check if a value exists in the list.
    The time complexity of the IN operator for lists is O(n).
    So the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

*** Task 2
    For the function update_phone_numbers():
        It has no loops, and the time complexity
        of getting value by key in a dict (dict.get(key)) is O(1).
        So the overall time complexity is O(1).

    I used 2 loops sequentially (lines 33 and 40), so the simplified time complexity is O(n).

    The overall time complexity is O(n).

*** Task 3
    For the function get_area_code(): I used IN operator to loop over a phone number.
    But because the phone number can't reach 11 digits long. So it's time complexity is O(1).

    I used the list.sort(), and it's time complexity is OO(n.log(n)).

    So the overall time complexity is O(n.log(n)).

*** Task 4
    There's loop at line 35. Inside that loop, there 4 other loops that will run sequentially.
    So the time complexity is O(n^2).

    I used the list.sort(), and it's time complexity is O(n.log(n)).

    So the overall time complexity is O(n^2).
