# Dijkstra's Algorithm
In the "Greedy Algorithms" lesson, we implemented the **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the distance of each node from the given source node. In this exercise, you'll implement the same **Dijkstra's algorithm to find the length of the shortest path between a given pair of nodes,** but this time we will have a better time complexity. First, let's build the graph.

## Graph Representation
In order to run Dijkstra's Algorithm, we'll need to add distance to each edge. We'll use the `GraphEdge` class below to represent each edge between a pair of nodes. You are free to create your own implementation of an undirected graph.
